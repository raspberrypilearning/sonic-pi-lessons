## Pull Requests

If you fix a mistake, bug or problem or have something to contribute, please create a pull request for each modification. Please consider grouping modifications sensibly, i.e. don't bundle typo fixes in the same pull request as code changes, instead file them separately.

Please note that sometimes things are done for pedagogical reasons so changes which make sense from a software engineering perspective (reducing duplication or making use of more advanced programming language features) may not be suitable to maintain the intended educational value.
