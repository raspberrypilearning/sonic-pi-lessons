## Making a class set of SD cards

Once you have completed the steps above, you can make a copy of your master SD card and then use that to make a class set.

1. Place your master SD card in a computer or laptop with an SD card reader. 
2. On Windows use [Win disk 32 imager](http://sourceforge.net/projects/win32diskimager/) to make a copy of an SD card. On Mac OSX you can use the `dd` command or a [dd-gui](http://www.gingerbeardman.com/dd-gui/).
3. Remove the master SD card and keep it safe.
4. Take a fresh SD card and insert it into your computer or laptop. 
5. Format the SD card then, using your imaging software, select the image and write it to the card.
6. Repeat the last step for the rest of your cards.
